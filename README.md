# A simple demo for Core ML in Swift

At WWDC 2017, Apple released a lot of exciting frameworks and APIs for us developer to use. Among these releases, the most popular one was Core ML. Core ML is a framework that can be harnessed to integrate machine learning models into your app. The best part about Core ML is that you don’t require extensive knowledge about neural networks or machine learning. Another bonus feature about Core ML is that you can use pre-trained data models as long as you convert it into a Core ML model. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using a Core ML model that is available on Apple’s Developer Website. Without further ado, let’s start to learn Core ML.
